## Description
The Social Network API is a backend application that provides the foundation for a social networking web application. It is built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the NoSQL database, and Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling library. This API allows users to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage their friend lists.
